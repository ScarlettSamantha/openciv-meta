The issue is in Europe in the medieval era, a lot of houses were ruling portions of countries that are currently independent empires or nation-states.

There were also a lot of great empires that got taken over by another empire or merged with an empire. For example, Dutch [William III of Orange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_III_of_England) was Stadthouder of the Netherlands. Then, when the [Glorious Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glorious_Revolution) happened, he also became [William II of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_III_of_England) etc. etc.

A similar situation occurred with Spain and the [Habsburg family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Habsburg). The Habsburgs ruled not only Spain but also vast territories in Europe. This meant that the same people were often in charge of multiple countries, or close family members were ruling neighboring or even distant lands. For instance, [Charles I of Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_Spain) was also [Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_V,_Holy_Roman_Emperor), making him the leader of both Spain and a significant portion of central Europe.

This overlapping of leadership made it difficult to attribute a leader to just one country since many of them ruled over multiple territories simultaneously or were closely related to other rulers. This interconnectedness of royal families often blurred the lines between nations, making European politics during this period quite complicated.
